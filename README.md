# A mobile application called PatiTarifka  
This repository presents an example of recipe application taught by [Kodluyoruz](https://www.kodluyoruz.org/)

The app is implemented by using **react-native**. We use **Axios** to pull the information of recipes retrieved from [TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php). Furthuremore, we benefited from **Lottie** component to create loading and error animations.

We perform **react-navigation** in order to manage stack structure of the mobile app.
There are three pages to show the instrucitons of meals. The one is FoodChategory page that shows all the meal chategories. The other is Meals page that gets specific meals related to the selected chategory. The last one is FoodDetail page that presents the recipe of selected meal. You can watch the recipe on Youtube via tapping created button in the FoodDetail page.
